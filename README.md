# My Personal Project: Tempo
_Tempo_ is a speedcubing timer programmed in Java. It will be used to time Rubik's Cube solves, generate random cube scrambles, track personal records, and display statistics and visualizations that show trends in recorded times.
After a solve is complete, the solve time will be saved so that it persists after the program is terminated. Times will also be able to be manually added and removed.

## Who is this for, and why am I making it?

_Speedcubers_ (or _cubers_ for short) are people who enjoy solving twisty puzzles, like the Rubik's Cube, as quickly as possible. My personal best is just under 9 seconds!

While it is possible to time yourself using a stopwatch (or stopwatch app), it is clunky and does not keep track of the *history* of your solves, which is essential for gauging improvement and progression.

Cube timers are, in essence, souped-up stopwatches which record every time that they measure. They can also contain helpful features such as scramble generation and data visualizations.

There exist several cubing timers, but none are perfect in my opinion. I have been meaning to design my own for a while now, and I believe that I can do so while fulfilling the requirements of the term project.
