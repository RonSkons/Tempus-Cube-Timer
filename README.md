# My Personal Project: Tempus
_Tempus_ is a speedcubing timer programmed in Java. It will be used to time Rubik's Cube solves, generate random cube scrambles, track personal records, and display statistics and visualizations that show trends in recorded times.
After a solve is complete, the solve time will be saved so that it persists after the program is terminated. Times will also be able to be manually added and removed.
